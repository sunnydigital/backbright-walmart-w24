Paragraph
---------

At a glance, it is easy to see that unshift() started at around 100 μs but ended up around 1 s. In contrast, push() started at around 50 μs but ended up at around 3 ms. From a similar order of magnitude, the unshift() function ended three orders of magnitude higher than the push() function: the unshift() function scales worse than push()

unshift() is slower (scales worse) than push() due to it needing another O(N) to move back all the shifted elements
