            I grew up in the rocktop Palisades area of Fort Lee, NJ. The area is suburban and gorgeous, with a mix of both
            historic attributes such as <i>Historic Park</i> (shown below) and modern buildings (the buildings are literally called <i>The Modern</i>).

            There are a few parks in the area, each with it's own background and personal history.

        <ul class="unordered-justified">
            <li>
                <b>Constitution Park</b> is the quintissential Fort Lee park, welcoming both the young and old alike.
                It features a fully-flushed playground, along a 400-yard running-path, an outdoor calisthenics gym, and 
                a small memorial for 9/11.

            </div>
            <li>
                <b>Recreation Center</b> is from my childhood sentiments. It features a full-flushed playground, multiple tennis courts,
                and a basketball court that I would often play ball at.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Community Center</b> I never got too good at playing basketball, and so did visit the community center quite often, but 
                never as often as the other two parks listed above. It was all indoors, and was essentially a large basketball court, with multiple hoops
