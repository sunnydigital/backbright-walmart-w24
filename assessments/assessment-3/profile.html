            On his free time, he can be caught reading or exercising. Sunny is currently working on his squats and the books <i>A Tramp Abroad</i> by Mark Twain,
            and <i>Godel, Escher, Bach, an Eternal Golden Braid</i> by Douglas R. Hofstader. To him, each book is a journey,
            not only telling the viewpoints and stories of the people involved, but truly brings to life an idea. Sunny takes an interest in hiking and bouldering,
            and has recently tried snowboarding (of which he is an tired and hurt fan of).

        <p class="profile-paragraph">
            Sunny aims to work in a tech-focused role, to better understand the technicalities underlying how to implement machine learning models with proper alignment
            (works to the needs, but does not supercede) the goals of people. After learning from a software role, Sunny hopes to obtain more knowledge, particularly
            in terms of a degree or for research purposes, and work for a company focusing on research into these foundational topics (on top of alignment), such as Anthropic.
            Lastly, Sunny hopes to be able to one day found his own company, mixing research and consulting, to help the smaller-startups out their with their own data-driven needs.
