                On his free time, he can be caught reading or exercising. Sunny is currently working on his squats and the books <i>A Tramp Abroad</i> by Mark Twain,
                and <i>Godel, Escher, Bach, an Eternal Golden Braid</i> by Douglas R. Hofstader. To him, each book is a journey,
                not only telling the viewpoints and stories of the people involved, but truly brings to life an idea.
